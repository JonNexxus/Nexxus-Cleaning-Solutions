  - Web application (port 3000)
  - Admin application (port 3001)
  - PostgreSQL database (optional, for non-Supabase setups)
  - Redis cache
  - Nginx reverse proxy
- Health checks for all services
- Volume management for data persistence
- Network isolation and security

### 14.8: Nginx Reverse Proxy ✅
- Created production-ready Nginx configuration
- Features:
  - SSL/TLS termination
  - Rate limiting for API endpoints
  - Static asset caching
  - Gzip compression
  - Security headers
  - Separate configurations for web and admin
  - Admin panel IP whitelisting (configurable)
  - Health check endpoint routing

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service health
docker-compose ps
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy.sh staging web

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production all
```

### Option 3: Individual Services
```bash
# Build web application
docker build --target web-runner -t projectx-web .

# Build admin application
docker build --target admin-runner -t projectx-admin .
```
